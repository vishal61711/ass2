# ETH-proof-Beginner-EVM-course
In this we are making our project using solidity.

# Description
In this project, we will focus on implementing and understanding key concepts related to Ethereum smart contract development using Solidity. The project will involve the creation of a sample smart contract that showcases the usage of various functions, including the mint function and burnt function. Through this practical exercise, participants will gain insight into the execution and functionality of these functions within a smart contract context.


# Getting Started
installing
In this code is run the online platform i.e Online Remix IDE. we can directly publish our code through it or make new repository over github and create new file there.

# executing program
so after completion the code on online remix ide their and option of compile the program. After the compilation of code we need to deployed the code and check the functionality of our functions that we are used in our code.
